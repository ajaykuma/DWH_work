think if first source allows null or no null

--late arrving keys
--missing primary keys

substitute (null business keys) - with actual value of some sort.
primary_keys - business keys - -1  (may have history)
--cannot have more than -1 record/batch
optional_keys - -2 (does not have history)
--you can have any number per batch/per business key

-1 and -2 subsititution is designated at time of modelling..

-------------------
Should Business key should be not null column at source?

if we have null at source & load them to satellites with a host record mapping, these
records may always remain as ghost forever in the satellite tables when even if record gets
resolved at source.(because update in record will flow as fresh record into vault).

--we should have a businesss key which is unique across
  option - usage of surrogate key


similarly, if we have same BKs in source, problem may arise in loading in satellite.
