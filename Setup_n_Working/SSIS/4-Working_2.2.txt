--incremental load scenario

drop audit_log and recreate it with RecordsDeleted column.

--for example
IF  not EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[audit_log]') AND type in (N'U'))
create table audit_log(Id int identity, 
PackageName varchar(200), 
TableName varchar(200), 
RecordsInserted int, 
RecordsUpdated int,
RecordsDeleted int,
Dated datetime)
go

--we can delete data based on Id column which was used for updated/inserted etc..
--create new table as mentioned in CreateTable file

  ZZ_Emails_deleted

--Now we need input coming from flat file source which already goes into lookup.
So we can use multicast and send one copy of output to new OLE DB Destination..pointing to zz_deleted

--take the update statement
  update in 'execute sql statement' after data flow
declare @updated int, @deleted int
UPDATE a
   SET a.[First_name] = b.First_name
      ,a.[Last_name] = b.Last_name
      ,a.[Email] = b.Email
      ,a.[Gender] = b.Gender
 from [dbo].[Emails] a inner join [dbo].[ZZ_Email_updated] as b
 on a.Id = b.Id
set @updated = @@ROWCOUNT
delete a from Emails a where a.Id not in (select Id from [dbo].[ZZ_Emails_deleted])
set @deleted = @@ROWCOUNT

insert into [dbo].[audit_log]
select 'Package.dtsx', 'Emails', ?, @updated, @deleted, getdate()
