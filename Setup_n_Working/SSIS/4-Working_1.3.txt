--Using Lookup
----------------
In SQL Server Integration Services, the lookup component is one of the most frequently used tools for data validation and completion. 
The lookup component is provided as a means to virtually join one set of data to another to validate and/or retrieve missing values. 

The SSIS lookup cache selection will determine whether and how the distinct lookup values are cached during package execution(at runtime)
, and this can afect result of lookup & performance of package.



Step 1: Flat file connection manager > point to Bank_full.csv
        Remember to change data type for columns such as age and balance to DT_I4
	columns: all
Step 2: Lookup transformation editor:
        Cache Mode: Full Cache
        Connection type: OLE DB connection manager
<redirect rows to no match output>
Step 3: connection > Use a table > dbo.Dest_Bank5 ( this is based on Bank_full.csv but has all data for marital="married" deleted)
Step 4: columns > Available input columns : serNo < connected to>
                  Available Lookup columns : serNo
                  plus all columns selected.

Step 5: OLE DB Destination for No match output : Destination_Bank_nomatch
        Sort (based on age descending) > Derived columns to add 2 columns to table containing matched data (ageGroup and creattime)
        > Lookup match output > Destination_Bank_match

Full cache: full cache mode will cause the lookup transformation to retrieve and store in SSIS cache the 
entire set of data from the specified lookup location. As a result, the data flow in which the lookup 
transformation resides will not start processing any data buffers until all of the rows from the lookup query have been cached in SSIS.

Partial cache: When using the partial cache setting for the SSIS lookup cache mode, lookup values will still be cached, 
but only as each distinct value is encountered in the data flow. Initially, each distinct value will be retrieved
 individually from the specified source, and then cached. To be clear, this is a row-by-row lookup for each distinct key value(s).

No cache:  no cache mode will not add any values to the lookup cache in SSIS. As a result, every single row in the pipeline 
data set will require a query against the lookup source. Since no data is cached, it is possible to save a small amount of overhead 
in SSIS memory in cases where key values are not reused


Control Flow:
    Data Flow: Flat File Source > Lookup > Lookup Match Output     > sort > derived colums > OLE DB Destination
                                         > Lookup No Match Output  > OLE DB Destination

--check tables.
nomatch table contains data with marital == "married" which was deleted in dbo.Dest_Bank5 and did not match with file source.
match table contains data for all columns as Null from flatfile source and data in lookup where matching happened.

SELECT count(*)  FROM [mydb].[dbo].[Destination_Bank_match]
select count(*) from mydb.dbo.Dest_Bank5
select count(*) from mydb.dbo.Bank_full where marital !='married'
