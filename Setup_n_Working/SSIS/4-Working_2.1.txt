--Loading only new files in SSIS

Store the files processed to a tbl_log table and before loading any further
 file we check i fthe file is already loaded then we don't load it again..


Step 1: create 3 variables
FilePath: point to Customer_1.csv
RecordsLoaded: 
IsFileAlreadyLoaded: (if file is not loaded then value would be 0 or would be non-zero)

Step 2: create new package > control flow > add 'execute sql task' < contains sql from CreateTable file.
Step 3: Add 'Foreach Loop Container' > Collection > Foreach File Enumerator
        C:\Users\Ajay\Desktop\Others\sampledata
        *.CSV
        Add mappings : point to FilePath
Step 4: Add dataflow into 'foreach loop container'
Step 5: Open dataflow > add flatfile and point to 1st CSV ie Customer_1.csv
Step 6: Add Row count and select 'RecordsLoaded' variable.

--check connection manager used in data flow> connection strings > points to @[User::FilePath]
Step 7: in Control flow, add 'execute sql path'

insert into tbl_logs
select 'File loaded', 'file name', 100, getdate()

SQLStatementSource:
"insert into tbl_logs
select 'File loaded', " +@[User::FilePath]+ ","+ (DT_WSTR,12)@[User::RecordsLoaded] +", getdate()"

>evaluate expression..
