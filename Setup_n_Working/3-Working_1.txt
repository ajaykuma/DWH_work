To restore your database in SQL Server Management Studio, follow these steps:

--Download the appropriate .bak file
--Move the .bak file to your SQL Server backup location. This varies depending on your installation location, instance name and version of SQL Server. 

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL

--Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to your SQL Server.
--Right-click Databases in Object Explorer > Restore Database... to launch the Restore Database wizard.
--Select Device and then select the ellipses (...) to choose a device.
--Select Add and then choose the .bak file you recently moved to the backup location. If you moved your file to this location but you're not able to see it in the wizard, this typically indicates a permissions issue - SQL 
Server or the user signed into SQL Server does not have permission to this file in this folder.
--Select OK to confirm your database backup selection and close the Select backup devices window.
--Check the Files tab to confirm the Restore as location and file names match your intended location and file names in the Restore Database wizard.
--Select OK to restore your database.
--click and expand the DB/DW and see if everything is fine.
